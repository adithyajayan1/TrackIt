## üíª Setup and Run Locally
Follow these steps to get your TrackIt application up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or higher)

npm (Node Package Manager)

MongoDB Atlas Account (for cloud database) or local MongoDB instance

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project from your GitHub repository:

git clone https://github.com/adithyajayan1/TrackIt.git
cd TrackIt

2. Backend Setup
Navigate into the server directory, install dependencies, and set up your environment variables.

cd server
npm install

Create a .env file in the server directory with the following content:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<your_mongodb_username>:<your_mongodb_password>@cluster0.your_cluster_id.mongodb.net/expense-tracker-db?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here

Important:

Replace <your_mongodb_username> and <your_mongodb_password> with the credentials of a new database user you create in MongoDB Atlas.

Replace cluster0.your_cluster_id.mongodb.net with your actual MongoDB Atlas cluster connection string.

Ensure your IP address is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas Network Access settings.

Replace your_super_secret_jwt_key_here with a strong, random string for JWT.

Start the Backend Server:

npm run dev
Or, for a simple start: npm start

The server will run on http://localhost:5000. Keep this terminal window open.

3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal window, navigate into the client directory, and install dependencies.

cd ../client
npm install

Note: If you encounter npx tailwindcss init -p errors, ensure npm install completed successfully. Create React App (CRA) handles Tailwind compilation automatically with the config files.

Start the Frontend Development Server:

npm start

This will open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another available port).
